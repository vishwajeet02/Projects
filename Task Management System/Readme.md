# Task Management System

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Task Management System** project! This is a simple and powerful tool designed to help users create, manage, and track their tasks. Built using Python and Streamlit, the system allows users to add tasks, complete them in order, and view their task history. The project demonstrates basic data structures like Queues and Stacks, while offering a clean and user-friendly UI.

Whether youâ€™re a beginner learning about data structures or an experienced developer looking for a project to contribute to, this repository provides a great learning platform.

## Features

- **Task Creation**: Add new tasks with a title, description, and ID.
- **Task Completion**: Complete tasks in the order they are created and move them to a completed task history.
- **Task History**: View a list of all completed tasks, including the time and date they were completed.
- **Data Structures**: Implements Queue (for pending tasks) and Stack (for completed tasks) to manage tasks.
- **Streamlit UI**: A simple, interactive user interface to manage tasks efficiently.
